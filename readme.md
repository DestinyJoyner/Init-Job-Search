### Welcome to inIT - Where Opportunities Begin!

Are you tired of scrolling through endless job boards, only to find positions that require years of experience you don't have? Look no further! Introducing inIT, the mobile-first job search engine designed to connect entry-level tech talent with employers eager to hire fresh faces.

At inIT, we believe that everyone deserves a shot at their dream job, even if they're just starting out. Founded by a lone wolf developer (yours truly) who knows the struggle of breaking into the tech industry, inIT is a labor of love aimed at helping recent coding bootcamp and college program graduates kick-start their careers.

Here at inIT, our mission is simple: to bridge the gap between entry-level talent and employers hungry for fresh perspectives. We're not just a job search engine â€“ we're matchmakers, pairing bright-eyed graduates with companies eager to nurture and grow their talent.
